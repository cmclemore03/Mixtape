    <p> Come as you are, as you were<br />
      As I wanted you to be<br />
      As a friend; As an old enemy<br />
      Take your time, hurry up.<br />
      Choice is yours, don't be late.<br />
      Take a rest as a friend, as a an old memoria<br/>
      Memoria<br />
      Memoria<br />
      Memoria<br /></p>

    <h3 id="second">Beat It</h3>
    <p> You have to show them that you're really not scared (Ooh!)<br />
      You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare (Ooh!)<br />
      They'll kick you, then they'll beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair<br />
      So beat it, but you wanna be bad<br />
    [Chorus]<br />
     Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it<br />
     No one wants to be defeated<br />
     Showin' how funky and strong is your fight<br />
     It doesn't matter who's wrong or right<br />
     Just beat it<br /></p>

    <h3 id="third">Under Pressure</h3>
    <p> Pressure pushing down on me pressing down on you, no man ask for<br />
      Under pressure that burns a building down<br />
      Splits a family in two<br />
      Puts people on streets<br />
      It's the terror of knowing what this world is about<br />
      Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out!"<br />
      Pray tomorrow gets me higher<br />
      Pressure on people, people on streets<br /></p>

    <h3 id="fourth">Just The Two of Us</h3>
    <p> I see the crystal raindrops fall<br />
      And the beauty of it all<br />
      Is when the sun comes shining through<br />
      To make those rainbows in my mind<br />
      When I think of you sometime<br />
      And I want to spend some time with you<br />
      Just the two of us,<br />
      We can make it if we try,<br />
      Just the two of us,<br /></p>

    Three nights at the motel under streetlights in the City of Palms<br />
    Call me what you want, when you want, if you want (Want)<br />
    And you can call me names if you call me up (Call me up)<br />
    Three nights at the motel under streetlights in the City of Palms<br />
    Call me what you want, when you want, if you want<br />
    And you can call me names if you call me up (Ooh)<br />

    With the lights out, it's less dangerous<br />
    Here we are now, entertain us. I feel stupid and contagious<br />
    Here we are now, entertain us<br />
    A mulatto, an albino. A mosquito, my libido<br />
    Yeah, hey, yay<br/></p>

    <h3 id="eighth">What's the Use?</h3>
    <p> You can love it, you can leave it<br />
    They say you're nothin' without it<br />
    Don't let them keep you down<br />
    What if I don't need it?<br />
    There's somethin' about it<br />
    That just freaks me out<br />
    I just want another minute wit' it, fuck a little. What's the use?<br />
    Never superficial, you gon' know it when it hit you. Get a little sentimental when I'm off the juice<br /></p>

    <h3 id="nineth">The Less I Know The Better</h3>
    <p> Someone said they left together<br />
    I ran out the door to get her<br />
    She was holding hands with Trevor. Not the greatest feeling ever<br />
    Said, "Pull yourself together<br />
    You should try your luck with Heather"<br />
    Then I heard they slept together. Oh, the less I know the better<br />
    The less I know the better<br />
    <br />
    [Chorus]<br />
    Oh, my love. Can't you see yourself by my side?<br />
    No surprise. When you're on his shoulder like every night<br />
    Oh, my love. Can't you see that you're on my mind?<br />
    Don't suppose you could, convince your lover to change his mind<br />
    So goodbye<br /></p>

    <p> He bag production, he got walrus gumboot<br />
    He got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker<br />
    He got feet down below his knee<br />
    Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease<br />
    <br />
    [Chorus]<br />

    Over me<br /></p>

    <h3 id="eleventh">I WANNA BE YOUR SLAVE</h3>
    <p> I wanna be your slave, I wanna be your master<br />
    I wanna make your heartbeat run like rollercoasters<br />
    I wanna be a good boy, I wanna be a gangster<br />
    'Cause you can be the beauty and I could be the monster<br />
    I wanna make you quiet, I wanna make you nervous<br />
    I wanna set you free but I'm too fucking jealous<br />

    <h3 id="thirteenth">I Want You Back</h3>
    <p> When I had you to myself, I didn't want you around<br />
    Those pretty faces always made you stand out in a crowd<br />
    But someone picked you from the bunch, one glance was all it took<br />
    Now it's much too late for me to take a second look<br />
    <br />
    [Chorus]<br />
    Oh, baby, give me one more chance (To show you that I love you)<br />
    Won't you please let me (Back in your heart)<br />

    [Chorus]
    'Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner. I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner<br />
    I play my music in the sun<br />
    I'm a joker, I'm a smoker. I'm a midnight toker<br />
    I get my lovin' on the run<br />3</p>
